# Relations-Sets-and-Graphs

The project includes two parts Programming and Theory.

Relations:
Input: You must take two sets like A and B with a minimum of 3 elements
(arbitrary) in each set.
Output: Program will have to give us the following six results:
• The numbers of relations.
• The number of reflexive Relations.
• The number of symmetric Relations.
• The Number of relation both symmetric and antisymmetric.
• The number of antisymmetric relations.
• The number of relations that are both reflexive and symmetric.

Theory Part:
Write a report (at least 3-5 pages) which must include the applications of following
topics in Real life and CS.
• Sets
• Relations
• Graphs
• Minimum Spanning Trees
